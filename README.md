# AZUBI AFRICA TALENT MOBILITY PROGRAM ASSESSMENT

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
As a member of the data analytics team, my role involves creating tools that use the bank's operational data to help the business achieve its goals and projections.</br>
For this project, I have been tasked to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (indicated by the variable "y" as "yes" or "n" as "no"). My task involves analyzing the dataset to assess trends and inisghts. Also, I am tasked to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit based on the features provided in the dataset.

Sample of my tasks are as follows;
1. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</br>
I identify patterns, correlations, and any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization. 


2. Feature Engineering</br>
I evaluate which features might be most relevant to predicting client subscription and consider creating new features if applicable. 


3. Build a Predictive Model</br> 
I use a machine learning algorithm of choice to build a model predicting the subscription outcome. 


4. Evaluate Model Performance</br> 
I use appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model effectiveness. Also, I Consider any imbalanced classes and adjust accordingly, possibly using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting the class weights. 


5. Explain the Findings and Insights</br>
I summarize key findings from the EDA and insights from the model, such as which features were most impactful, common characteristics of clients likely to subscribe, and actionable recommendations for the marketing team. 


## THE DATA  
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

There are four datasets:  

- `bank-additional-full.csv` with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed. 
- `bank-additional.csv with` 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs. 
- `bank-full.csv` with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs).  
- `bank.csv` with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs).

The features of the dataset are;
